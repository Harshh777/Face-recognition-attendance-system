# Facial Recognition Attendance System

## Introduction
This project introduces an automated attendance management system that leverages facial recognition technology. Developed in Python, it replaces traditional, often inaccurate attendance methods with a secure, user-friendly, and efficient alternative. Utilizing a webcam for image capture and the Deepface library for facial recognition, it streamlines attendance tracking in educational and professional settings.

## Background
Traditional attendance systems are prone to errors and can be inefficient. Our solution uses facial recognition to offer a more reliable and faster way to manage attendance. With the power of Python's libraries like OpenCV for image capture, Deepface for facial recognition, and Pandas for data management, this system provides a significant improvement over manual sign-ins and RFID cards.

## Technology Stack
- **OpenCV:** Image capture and processing.
- **Deepface:** Facial recognition utilizing models such as Facenet and VGG-Face.
- **Pandas:** Data management for attendance records.
- **Streamlit:** Front-end user interface.
- **Streamlit Authenticator:** Security for user login.

## Features
- Accurate and efficient facial recognition for attendance.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- Secure login with Streamlit Authenticator.
- Real-time feedback and confirmation of attendance.
- Efficient management of attendance data with Pandas.

# Run the Streamlit application
